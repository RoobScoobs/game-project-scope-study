# Game Project Scope Study

## Required Readings

-   [Game Project](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/game-project)
-   [Game API](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/game-project-api)
-   [What is a User Story](http://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/definition/user-story)

## Deliverables

After reading the `game-project` prompt and the `game-project-api` documentation
please do the following and be prepared to share and discuss during our next
class.

Submit detailed answers to these in this file via a pull request.

-   A wireframe of what your game project will look like.

  Link to wireframe: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SdnAoFjvBdx4d7wwNC7oRoYTdVFwGGAGLumOoOOGQfM/edit?usp=sharing

-   The data structure you plan to use.

  Registration and login will make use of jQuery and Ajax in order to make the
  elements interactive and allow such data to be communicated between the backend
  and the front end. The game board itself will make use of a Javascript
  array and strings in order to track game statistics such as winners, ties, and games played.


-   How you will take the markup of the game board and represent it in JS

  The tic-tac-toe game board is represented by 3x3 clickable spaces. We can use jQuery
  to take the values of user input, and program functions using logic in JS to make
  sense of the game board.   

-   How you plan to approach this project.

  Setting feasible goals and completing them each day will help in moving closer
  to a finished project. The most important elements to tackle should be prioritized
  (e.g. the game logic and communication between the api and client). Elements of style
  can be implemented after the application is up and running successfully.   

-   4-8 user stories for your game project.

  As a user, I want to seamlessly play tic-tac-toe against my friends so I can enjoy myself.
  As a user, I want to be able to sign up for a new account so I can get started.
  As a user, I want to be able to log in so I can see all my tracked game statistics.
  As a user, I want to be able to change my password so I can have security over my account.
  As a user, I want to play on my mobile phone.

-   How you plan to keep your code modular.

  Separating code into appropriately named files, rather than attaching and combining
  chunks of irrelevant code all in one file, will help keep the code modular.
  For instance, we can create a separate file for the HTML skeleton of the page,
  CSS styling, Api's, Ajax requests, jQuery event handlers, and JS functions.

-   What creative spin will you add to your project.

  I'll attempt to add some unique, fun animations during the actual game.  

-   How you will use version control to backup / track your project.

  I plan on making frequent commits with good commit messages to keep track of my
  project on my local repository as well as my remote Github account.

-   Do you plan to attempt any of the bonuses.

  I want to attempt to make a responsive tic-tac-toe game, but we'll see if I have
  the time to include the feature.
